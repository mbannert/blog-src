## Hi,

I am Matthias. I am a software developer with an economics / statistics background.
Linkedin aficionados would probably say I am a *data scientist*. After completing my doctorate, I moved to the [ETH Zurich'](https://www.ethz.ch) IT department, more precisely the [KOF Swiss Economic Institute's](https://kof.ethz.ch) IT. I help to make establishment statistics' data pipelines more convenient, but also help empirical researchers of different fields to adopt software development habits.

Speaking of software development, I like most things R (except stringAsFactors = TRUE) and PostgreSQL. Yet, I am perfectly neutral in language wars (except for when people think SPSS or STATA were a languages). And yes, I am totally open to Python for scientific use. I like to explore other languages and stacks such as Go and also worked in web development when I was younger. As long as it's open source I am listening.

However, nowadays the R language is my most regular companion. I write and maintain packages to make establishment statistics a little more fun: *timeseriesdb* is an R interface to PostgreSQL and was built to manage and archive (macroeconomic) time series. *tstools* is an R toolbox to perform typical establishment statistics operations (as of now mostly plotting) on time series. *Radwords* is an API wrapper around Google's Adwords interface and obviously doesn't fit into establishment statistics tale. The package is joint work with my buddy [@jburkhardt](https://github.com/jburkhardt/Radwords) and is part of my professional links outside academia. Please find more about my open source work [here]().

I also enjoy teaching and try to offer a course every semester. Basically all of my courses try to address the programming part of using R, the hacker's habits, the git, the package building, the deployment or simply getting in efficient in using one's working in environment. In other words I try to teach all the stuff you don't have time for when you had to learn stats in the same course, too. More about my courses and workshops, including course material can be found [here]().
