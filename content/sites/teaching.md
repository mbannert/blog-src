## Academia

Yes, I do enjoy teaching. To me, it's not research over teaching. Teaching has rather become a mission by popular demand. My current courses and workshops all try to fill the void that traditional, applied stats courses leave open: software development etiquette and habits. 

Admittedly, statistics courses often leave programming almost untouched for good reason. Who wants to think documentation, version control, object orientation or simply writing functions when one's head is already spinning cause of kernel densities, regressions or distributions?

Hence, I teach these concepts in dedicated software development courses for empirical researchers in academia and the commercial world. I found that if taught in dedicated, seperate
courses learners can greatly benefit from a few habits and tricks that are common to most developers but less known in research. That is particularly the case when R or Python is the first encounter with a programming language. Since 2013, I have taught the following courses:

  - 2017 Understanding Data Analytics (workshop for DAX enterprise, Germany)
  - 2017 Building Online Apps with R (block course, University of Constance, Germany)  
  - 2017 Basic Concepts of R Programming - An Introduction to Programming with Data for Empirical Social Researchers (block course, University of Constance, Germany)
  - 2016 Building Online Apps with R (block course, University of Constance, Germany)  
  - 2015 Exploring Statistics with R (block course, University of Constance, Germany)
  - 2014 Lecturer at Webdatanet Training School, Alexandroupolis, Greece
  - 2014 Exploring Statistics with R (semester course, University of Constance, Germany)
  - 2013 Principles of Econometrics (ETH Zurich, Switzerland)

All courses come with multiple examples and try-at-home exercises. Admittedly, the material ( slides should rather be seen as an aid-to-memory) are less useful without the lecture, but they are publicly available on [Rpubs](https://rpubs.com/mbannert) or on github. More example code and slides can be found on the respective course repositories: bacon [Basic Concepts of R Programming](https://github.com/mbannert/bacon) and boar [Building online apps with R](https://github.com/mbannert/boar).


## Consulting

I have consulted companies from start-ups to global players every now and then.
I also worked with NGOs and public institutions. Most of my earlier work was technical consulting in web projects as well as data analysis. Lately I also worked in data driven online marketing with Google Adwords and Google Analytics. Through our work on Radwords we're in touch with companies which use our open source products to optimize their online appearance.
