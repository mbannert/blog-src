An inspiring article. That captivating instructor. That instructive example. Or just the hype. No matter how (and why) you made first contact with the field formerly known as statistics (now data science), you will eventually ask yourself how to go on after your first encounter. One of the things that I recommend at the end of introductory workshops or course is to stay connected. Stay connected to the ongoing debate, even if you're not plan to become a full time data hacker. Following the data science community on twitter delivers you a free mix of good-morning-reads that consist of timely debates, comprehensive tutorials, code examples, jaw-dropping visualizations or case studies. Here a 10 twitter accounts to follow ... 

<!-- more -->

1. [Mara Averick (@dataandme)](https://twitter.com/dataandme) <br/>
If you follow only one account, follow Mara. She picks up everything data, processes it, adds a grain of humor before sharing a relevant summary. From visualization, to stats, programming and stack â€“ her output is just a well rounded wrap up of information that keeps you motivated and informed. Btw: the follow-Mara-strategy is also a good option if you plan to stay off twitter yourself, just visit her account every now and then. 

2. [David Robinson (@drob - stackoverflow)](https://twitter.com/drob) <br/>
A guy who asks the right questions + knows how to analyze + has got stackoverflow data runs a blog to talk about it. If you ventured deep enough to know what stackoverflow is, it's probably obvious to you why @drob is well worth to follow. If you don't know yet what stackoverflow is or does, stay tuned for part II of my series on life after getting started. @drob picks up the gems of stackoverflow's data analysis: which programming languages are popular (or not) in which fields and regions of the world? How are programmers salaries distributed?  


3. [Richie Cotton (@richierocks - datacamp)](https://twitter.com/richierocks) <br/>
Richie is an elite stats programmer whose puns can keep up with his hacking. He doesn't tweet as often as Mara or David but when he chirped it brought advice and smiles to my work day more than once.
Richie works for datacamp, a company which offers great video lessons around data in several programming languages (partly free).   

4. [Jeroen Ooms (@opencpu - R Studio, rOpenSci)](https://twitter.com/opencpu) <br/>
Jeroen Ooms is the guy behind opencpu and the R jsonlite package to name only 2 of his remarkable contributions. Not the most active talker on twitter. Tweets mostly about package releases. Browsing his followers gives you more inspiration on who to follow.


5. [David Smith (@revodavid - Microsoft)](https://twitter.com/revodavid) <br/>
Revolution Analytics was probably the best known commercial #rstats based company when it was bought by no other than Microsoft. Ever since then Microsoft has continued to integrate rstats into their products from SQL Server to Azure. Their commitment has definetely helped raised acceptance of the
R Language within enterprise. David has been with Revolution for quite a while and also writes on their blog.


6. [Pieter Levels (@levelsio - Nomadlist, gofuckingdoit, ...)](https://twitter.com/levelsio) <br/>
Pieter Levels is what he would call a 'maker'. He starts and runs businesses with a better-done-than-perfect approach in order to validate a minimum viable product. Good organization of himself, educated hunches, moderate programming knowledge and zero employees are his trademarks. In the meantime his rep helps to start new businesses, too. His breakthrough project was Nomadlist a user driven ranking of places to stay for digital nomads. He tweets about stack and technology, business and travelling. He has a larger follower base than most people and is certainly a node in his part of the social media universe. 


7. [xkcd (@xkcd_rss)](https://twitter.com/xkcd_rss)<br/>
Nerdy jokes, twitter feed of the *xkcd* comic strips. A developer's classic. Like the humor our leave it out. Use it as benchmark: If you start laughing about the jokes - you'd probably enjoy software development, too. Alternative: @iamdeveloper.


8. [Dirk Eddelbuettel (@eddelbuettel)](https://twitter.com/eddelbuettel)<br/>
Dirk Eddelbuettel is also not a huge talker, but a software development heavyweight. Few people got a github stampcard like him. He is active in the Debian Linux world and rstats and countless other projects. His seemless integration of R and C++ is used by 1250 (!) R packages and counting.

9. [@rOpenSci](https://twitter.com/rOpenSci) <br/>
Let them talk for themselves: rOpenSci fosters a culture that values open and reproducible research using shared data and reusable software. Its founding members Karthik Ram (@_inundata) and Scott Chamberlain (@sckottie) (and basically all of their staff) could easily have made the list. In fact Jeroen Ooms did make my list (#4). So, I cheat here and extend this to a list of 20+ something accounts...


10. [@whatsgoodio](https://twitter.com/whatsgoodio) <br/>
Well, that's me. No, I can't compete with the output of the 9 accounts mentioned above.
Yet, the fact that you reading this tells me you somehow found me looking for help or information in the broad (and widening) field statistics and data juggling. I stay to connected, tweet at a moderate pace and write a larger piece here and there. The fact that I list myself here shows this little list is not a Top 10. It's rather a sample(proven_data_accounts,10) approach. Please note that, sampling probabilities subject to personal bias.
